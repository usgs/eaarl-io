/**
 * @file eaarlio/version.h
 * @brief Version information for the library
 *
 * The eaarlio library follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] for its version
 * numbers. This means that a version number consists of three or four
 * components. Release versions are numbered as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH and
 * pre-release versions are numbered as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE.
 *
 * The full version string is available in ::EAARLIO_VERSION. However, each
 * component is also separately defined to make it easier to do version
 * checking.
 *
 * - ::EAARLIO_VERSION_MAJOR increments when an incompatible API change is made
 * - ::EAARLIO_VERSION_MINOR increments when new functionality is added that
 *   is backwards-compatible
 * - ::EAARLIO_VERSION_PATCH increments when backwards-compatible bug fixes are
 *   made
 * - ::EAARLIO_VERSION_PRERELEASE is defined only when this is a pre-release
 *   version; pre-release versions should be considered unstable and may not
 *   properly satisfy the compatibility indicated by the version number
 *
 * [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0]: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
