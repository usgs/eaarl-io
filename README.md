# EAARL Input/Output Library

This library provides a C API that you can use within your own programs for I/O
access to raw data collected by the EAARL-A and EAARL-B lidar systems. As such,
the primary intended audience for this library are users who are need to add
EAARL I/O capabilities to their existing applications.

A few small standalone utility programs are also included that can be used to
inspect EAARL data. One of the program exports the data as YAML, a common
human-readable data format. This provides users another avenue for getting
EAARL data into their existing applications.

Full documentation for eaarl-io is available at
<https://usgs.github.io/eaarl-io>.  Alternately, refer to
[doc/documentation.md](doc/documentation.md) as a starting point for browsing
or generating the documentation locally.

The EAARL sensors were operational between 2001 and 2014. This library is part
of a final effort to make EAARL data acquisitions more accessible to the
public. Related software includes:

* [eaarl-py](https://github.com/usgs/eaarl-py), a starting place for exploring
  EAARL data in Python. It allows you to access EAARL waveform data and
  provides a simplified basic processing workflow that you can adapt to
  experiment with the data.

The USGS has no plans for further development or support of EAARL or of its
associated software (including this library).

## Building

You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org) to generate build files for your
platform. CMake is used to support cross-platform build configuration.

The basic steps to compile on Linux using gcc and make:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

The basic steps to compile on Windows using Visual Studio 2015:

1. Launch the CMake GUI
    1. Select the source code directory ("Where is the source code:")
    2. Select a separate directory for the build ("Where to build the binaries:")
    3. Click "Configure"
    4. Choose your version of Visual Studio under "Specify the generator for this project"
    5. Leave "Use default native compilers" enabled
    6. Click "Finish"
    7. If you plan to install the software, check that CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set to the destination directory you want to use.
    8. Click "Generate"
2. Launch Visual Studio 2015
    1. File > Open > Project/Solution and select the EAARLIO.sln file in the build directory.
    2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on ALL_BUILD and select Build.

Refer to [doc/index.md](doc/index.md#building) for more details on building.
